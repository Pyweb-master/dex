# Debugging

* Debug the Solidity Smart Contract in Remix IDE
* Verify the Solidity Smart Contract compiles by pasting it in MIST using https://github.com/ltfschoen/geth-node
* Verify the Solidity Smart Contract compiles by deploying it to Ethereum TestRPC using Truffle

# TODO

* [ ] - Incorporate Automated Market Maker (AMM) similar to that described in 0x Whitepaper

# Initial Setup - Truffle, TestRPC, Unit Tests (FixedSupplyContract)

* Install Truffle
  * Reference: http://truffleframework.com/

```
npm install -g truffle
```

* Setup Truffle to Manage Contracts (i.e. MetaCoin sample), Migrations and Unit Tests

```
truffle init

truffle migrate --network development
```

* Initialise with Front-End
  * Truffle Default
    * https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-init-default
  * Truffle Webpack
    * https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-init-webpack
    * https://github.com/truffle-box/webpack-box
  * Truffle React
    * http://truffleframework.com/boxes/
  * Truffle Drizzle
    * http://truffleframework.com/docs/drizzle/getting-started

    * Created a new `truffle unbox drizzle` project and copied the relevant files to the existing project and fixed errors

* Truffle Configuration File Examples
  * http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration
  * Note: Use `from` to specify the From Address for Truffle Contract Deployment.
  * Use the Mnemonic to Restart TestRPC with the same Accounts.
  * Note: Use `provider` to specify a Web3 Provider
  * Note: Truffle Build `truffle build` script for say Webpack is usually in package.json

* Truffle with Test Framework using Ethereum TestRPC (avoid delays in mining transactions with Geth Testnet)
  * Ethereum TestRPC - In-Memory Blockchain Simulation

```
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

  * Start Ethereum Blockchain Protocol Node Simulation with 10x Accounts on http://localhost:8500
    * Creates 10x Private Keys and provides a Mnemonic. Assigns to each associated Address 100 Ether.
    * Note: Private Keys may be imported into Metamask Client 
    * Note: Mnemonic may be used subsequently with Ethereum TestRPC to re-create the Accounts with `

```
ganache-cli
```

  * Restart TestRPC with Same Accounts (i.e. `ganache-cli --mnemonic "copy obey episode awake damp vacant protect hold wish primary travel shy"`)

```
ganache-cli --port 8500 --mnemonic <INSERT_MNEMONIC> 
```

* Add FixedSupplyToken to Truffle Contracts folder
* Remove MetaCoin from Truffle Contracts folder
* Update 2nd Migration file to deploy FixedSupplyToken

* Compile and Deploy the FixedSupplyToken Contract

```
truffle migrate --network development
```

* Run Sample Unit Tests on the Truffle MetaCoin Contract. Truffle Re-Deploys the MetaCoin Contracts

```
truffle test
```

# Infura

* Refer to Truffle Infura instructions http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/using-infura-custom-provider
* Refer to blog post with Infura setup instructions https://blog.infura.io/getting-started-with-infura-28e41844cc89
* Sign-up to Infura https://infura.io/signup
* Check email for Infura access token
* Add Infura URLs to .env file, prefix with `REACT_APP_`, and use with `process.env.REACT_APP_`

* Environment variables
  * Create a .env file in the root directory to protect Infura keys from being published on Github:

```
NODE_ENV="development"
REACT_APP_INFURA_ROPSTEN_TESTNET_URL="https://mainnet.infura.io/<ENTER_INFURA_TOKEN_HERE>"
```

  * Prefix all environment variables in the .env file with REACT_APP_ as this is a requirement of create-create-app https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-custom-environment-variables.

  * Use the environment variables in the code implementation. i.e. `const web3 = new Web3(process.env.REACT_APP_INFURA_ROPSTEN_TESTNET_URL, net);`

  * Create a .gitignore file with `touch .gitignore` whose contents contains the line `.env`

  * Update package.json with the environment variable i.e. `"start": "NODE_ENV=development node scripts/start.js",`

# Troubleshooting

* Try restarting Ganache TestRPC if you encounter error `sender doesn't have enough funds to send tx. The upfront cost is: x and the sender's account only has: y`

* Fix error `Error: Error: Exceeds block gas limit` that may occur when sending Gas Limit say of `50000000` when truffle.js has `gas` property set as `gas: 4712388,`, by changing to a smaller value: `myExchangeInstance.buyToken("FIXED", web3.toWei(4, "finney"), 5, {from: accounts[0], gas: 4000000});`

* Fix `Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: out of gas`. In the `buyToken` function it always occurs after a certain line of code. Simply increase the Gas Limit to the Mainnet's limit (currently shown as `7984452` at https://ethstats.net/) in both Ganache CLI Flags and in truffle.js

* Chrome Inspector Console error when try connect to http://localhost:8500 Custom RPC in Metamask when truffle.s and local Ganache CLI is running without a network id set

```
Injected web3 detected.
drizzle.js Error retrieving network ID:
drizzle.js TypeError: Cannot read property 'address' of undefined
    at http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:69225:103
From previous event:
    at new DrizzleContract (http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:69224:27)
    at Drizzle.getContracts
```

  * Tried `console.log(web3)` and `web3.currentProvider` successfully but still returns error.

  * Note that it momentarily worked but was showing the following error

```
Error: The current provider doesn't support subscriptions: MetamaskInpageProvider
```

  * **UNRESOLVED ISSUE**
